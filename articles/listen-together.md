# Listen Together

Sadly we had to cancel the Listen Together feature because it's not possible to implement it. We've tried our best to find a solution but it's simply not possible. An implementation would've been somewhat possible in macOS, but only for tracks in a playlist. No chance in Windows.

Example play track in playlist in macOS:

```applescript
tell app "music"
    play track "Thousand Miles" of playlist "Evening Commute"
end tell
```
